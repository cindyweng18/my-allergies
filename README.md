## My Allergies App
This app is to create a site where users can post their allergies and cross-examine products based on the allergies.

Brainstorming Steps:
1. Create back-end application with Flask that reads/extract text from PDF (and potentially images too) for users to post their allergies (or also manually type them)
2. Use AI (maybe) to find a product's ingredients based on user-inputted name, or user can post a picture (or link?)
3. Create a front-end application once a base back-end application is set
